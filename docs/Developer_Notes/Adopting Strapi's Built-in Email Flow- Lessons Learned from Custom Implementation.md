# Adopting Strapi's Built-in Email Flow: Lessons Learned from Custom Implementation

After engaging in several discussions with developers on the official Strapi Discord channel, I gained valuable insights and feedback. Although I was aware of the built-in features Strapi provides for email-based user registration, password reset, and email verification, I initially chose to custom-build these functionalities. My goal was to simultaneously learn and implement these processes on my own.

During the custom implementation, I encountered some minor issues, including occasional 401 errors and security concerns that could arise if not properly addressed. Developers on Discord emphasized the importance of ensuring security, particularly for user authentication and sensitive data handling. This feedback made me reconsider my approach.

Given the potential risks and the critical role of security in user management systems, I’ve decided to transition to Strapi’s built-in, stable features. By doing so, I can ensure a more robust and secure implementation, while also reducing the time spent troubleshooting minor issues. This decision allows me to focus on other aspects of the project, while leveraging Strapi’s trusted solutions for user registration, email verification, and password reset.

While I value the learning experience I gained through building these features from scratch, the shift to Strapi’s native functionalities will enhance the overall reliability and security of my application. I plan to maintain my previous custom implementation in a separate branch for reference, but moving forward, I’ll be relying on Strapi’s core systems to manage these critical flows.
